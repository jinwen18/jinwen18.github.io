This is Wen's home on the web!

I am a third-year Master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy, China. 

I am a visiting student in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interest lies in how we can improve Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) to understand individual brain. More specifically, I am interested in image processing and image analysis.
